## Possible Questions
---
Q: The widget flashes every time I tap/press.

A: I cannot control this behavior because BTT will re-render the button if its configuration is changed, and this is why I rename the widget to "switching"...

---
Q: I don't need to switching between multiple devices.

A: That's simple, type/paste the name of your device in `Environment Variables` in the configuration, such as `devNAME="TypeTheNameInHere"`, then change the assigned action to `Toggle Bluetooth Device Connection`, that's all.

Q: How to change background color of this widget?

---
Q: How does the python script do it?

A: python calls osascript to get mac address of your headphone, then the productID and battery info can be read from bluetooth.plist, based on the productID we can retrieve the image of your headphone by plists in IOBluetoothUI resources folder.

Apple will update product info along with macOS update, that's why it should work for all Apple headphones.

---
Q: No icon on touch bar

A: It may happens to the older macOS/OS X, in which there are no images of latest apple headphones, in this case, there's no other way but to create a resource folder to include plist and all the images manually.
